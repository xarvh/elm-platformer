- Darkness decreases walk acceleration -> sensazione di pesantezza
- "I'm useless, can't do this"
- "There is no way out"
- player respawn: "-sigh-, I guess I have no choice", "I have to try again", "I can't give up" -> resilenza?




- Can't jump down from edge of platforms

- Rewrite collision engine for arbitrary polygons
  * Merge adjacent tiles together
  * Separate one-way platform code from square obstacle code

- Need a Color module and type

- Tree render is spread across too many modules
